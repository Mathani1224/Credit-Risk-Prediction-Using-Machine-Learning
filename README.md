The Credit Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning project assesses the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan based on financial and demographic factors. Using data preprocessing, feature selection, and ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, the model predicts credit risk accurately. This helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions, reducing defaults and improving risk management.
